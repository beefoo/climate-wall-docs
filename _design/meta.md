## Meta message area

This section will cover material about the "meta message area", which are the 27 screens (9 screens x 3 screens, or 36 ft x ~6.8ft) above the 9 x 1 interactive screens

### Meta messages

Not to be written verbatim, but these are the overall "messages" that visuals should be built from

- Earth’s climate is a complex system that results from interactions between…
  - Atmosphere
  - Ocean
  - Ice
  - Land
  - Biosphere
- Earth’s climate is always changing but the current, rapid warming is the result of human activity.
- Release of greenhouse gases—mostly carbon dioxide from burning of fossils fuels—is driving climate change.
- The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is now higher than at any time in at least the last 800,000 years... and possibly in the last 3 million years.
- Scientists largely agree that Earth’s climate is changing because of human activity.

### Meta message content and visualizations

Some explorations on content we can put on the meta section
