## Technical considerations

This page will give an overview of technical concerns relating to the Climate Wall to facilitate conversations about costs and technical feasibility. This page does not focus on design concerns.

### Screens

Please [refer to this video (embedded below) for a visual aid](https://s3.amazonaws.com/brianfoo-amnh/climateWallVideo.mp4).

- 36 high definition screens laid out in a nine-by-four grid
- Each screen is four feet in width with a 16:9 aspect ratio, 1080p
- The bottom 9 screens will contain a mix of interactive (4-6 screens) and rendered (3-5 screens) content
- The meta content will be visible in the top 27 screens
    - Possibly visible as a subtle background in the bottom 9 screens
    - Will only contain rendered content
    - Likely will contain satellite imagery, CG, or graphics (i.e. not filmed content)
- Content in the bottom row _may_ bleed into the row above when appropriate
- Each of the 9 bottom screens and the meta content are independent from each other
- However, there has been discussion about having interactions in the bottom screens sometimes affect content on the big screen, but nothing has been concretely proposed yet

### Content update-ability

- Some screens on the bottom row will have data associated with them (e.g. temperature, CO<sub>2</sub>) that would need to be updated periodically
- Depending on the dataset, the frequency of updates will happen on a daily, weekly, monthly, or annually
- Some screens may be a rendered video that would need to be periodically updated or replaced (temporarily or permanently) - this would likely not be frequent or common
- Sometimes, custom rendered content would be added to the cycling content in the meta section to address current events - this would likely not be frequent or common

### Physical controls

- There will be four to six screens that contain interactive content and thus will require physical controls
- There will not be three screens in a row that will be interactive
- As of now, there will be up to two physical controls per interactive screen
- As of now, the types of physical controls include:
    - slider
        - smooth and continuous (i.e. not notched/incremental)
        - horizontal and vertical options
        - would like to be able to configure the friction/resistance
    - knob/dial (for precision or selection)
        - incremental and continuous options
        - would like to be able to configure the friction/resistance
    - crank (for acceleration/deceleration)
    - track ball (for rotating a globe, so larger the better)
    - button (for navigation)

### Label decks & boxes

Please [refer to this document for a visual aid](https://s3.amazonaws.com/brianfoo-amnh/HoPE_CC_IAbox-elevation_5-24-17.pdf).

- 20 x 9in is the max area for an interactive box on a label deck
    - 9 possible locations (at the center below each screen)
    - Cannot move horizontally
- 8 x 9in boxes can provide 10 additional locations on the label decks
    - Can move horizontally on label deck

### Sound

- Some interactive content (1 to 3 screens) may require audio feedback
- Sound should be as localized as possible
- Sound should consider surrounding sounds
- Sound should consider the noise levels of the hall
- Sound should have a "resting" mode when there is little to no interaction on the wall (as to not have persistent sound from the wall)
- Possibly, sound can be manually disabled by staff (or temporarily by visitors maybe)

### Haptic

- Haptics is also an option for providing feedback for the interactions
