## Considerations for placement of controls on glass panels

[Glass hole template document](../assets/docs/HoPE_deck_glass-holes.pdf) (10/12/2017)

As per Exhibition's recommendations:

>  So for the glass….the glass will need to be 1/4” thickness (instead of 1/8”), because of the longer decks.  We’ve made adjustments inside the “pan” in order to accommodate.  NOTE: Take a look at the drawings—I may have made the glass in the smaller caption panels 1/8”, since there are no cut-outs in those pieces).

>  For holes, no hole can be closer than 2x the thickness (t) from the edge.  That measurement is measured to the edge of the circle cut-out.  So, no hole edge can be closer than 1/2” to the edge of the glass.  For a corner hole, measuring in at a 45° angle from the corner, that measurement can be no smaller than 6 1/2(t).  That means that  measuring in at a 45° angle from the corner, towards the center of the glass, no hole’s edge can be closer than 1 5/8”.

>  For holes in the middle of the glass:  no cut-out can be more than 1/3 the glass short dimension.  So, no hole in the middle of the glass can be larger than 4.3” in diameter.  For the sliders, which need to be 5 1/2” long, it would be best if they could run horizontally only.  If there is a need for them to run vertically, I will have to have that particular case engineered, to make sure it’s okay.  If that condition can be avoided, that would be best.

>  For holes next to each other, the clear distance between them (edge to edge) is 2(t), or 1/2”.

>  Please look at drawings PE-4.3b for information on any bezels we had to design to cover the holes and keep the components in place.
