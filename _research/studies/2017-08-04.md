## Summary

Interactives were intuitive and engaging and prompted a desire to learn more about the context of the data they were interacting with. Primary learning objectives were met for those visitors we were able to ask. Additional chart/graph scaffolding is needed to address concepts of temperature anomaly, average temperature, and data selection.

## Key takeaways

- Visitors want more context: _"Why are these years hotter?", "Why do some places only have small changes?"_
- Color representation needs to be consistent and clear, e.g. _"Is pink good or blue good?"_
- Visitors want to know what is "average temperature", e.g. _"Does no changes means normal?" "Is steady good?"_
- Visitors want to know why certain years/data is chosen, e.g. _"Why did you choose these years? Why highlight these years?"_
- International visitors don't know Fahrenheit, e.g. _"What is Fahrenheit?"_
- Sound is engaging, but possibly distracting in the actual space, e.g. _"Can we change the sound? Otherwise it will be annoying when children are moving back and forth"_

## Action items

- Add context:
	- annotate temporal areas of cooling, warming (e.g. mid century warming/cooling period)
	- annotate geographical areas of cooling, warming (e.g. European heat wave)
	- add basic historical markers of significance (e.g. industrial revolution, WWII)
	- add basic geographical markers (e.g. New York City, equator)
- Define a clear color palette to represent cooling, warming
- Clearly define what the baseline (average) temperature is
- Make timeline for both interactive consistent
- Add celsius in parentheses
- Think about sound design and possibly test it in the actual space
