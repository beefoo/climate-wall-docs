## Summary

- Interactive button controls were mostly intuitive and engaging after brief playing; many pressed multiple buttons at once
- Nearly all visitors were able to answer _What's warming the planet?_ correctly, mostly citing the graph, and about half of the visitors said they learned something new
- There was some confusion about the prompts and labels

## Key takeaways

1. Visitors seem to enjoy the ability to press multiple buttons, though only some were clearly doing so to compare different graphs (many were just playing or _"making music"_)
1. If the buttons were placed horizontally, visitors were more likely to move through the buttons linearly (left to right); If placed in two rows, it was more open-ended (like a guessing game) and more likely to press multiple buttons at once
1. Some younger visitors interpret the question _What's warming the planet?_ as _What warms the planet?_ (i.e. _"The sun"_)
1. Some visitors wanted some further context/annotation on the graphs. _"Why volcano cools the planet? What happened in that year?"_
1. It was hard for visitors to articulate what each graph was (e.g. a graph of how volcanos make the climate warmer or cooler over time), even though they answered the prompt correctly; they seem to mostly rely on comparing the shapes/trends of the graph and identify which one is going up
1. Older visitors tended to read the pop-up text; younger ones not so much

## Action items

1. Consider re-phrasing the prompt to something like: _What's making the planet warmer?_ or _What's causing global warming?_
1. Consider other ways of organizing/placing/labeling the buttons to encourage open-ended interaction
1. Possibly provide additional content when multiple buttons are pressed, if/when applicable
1. Consider reducing the length of each pop-up text if possible
1. Explore more ways of making it clear that each graph shows how much a particular factor makes the climate warmer or cooler over time

## Feedback for tools/process for evaluation

1. Thursday mid-day had better visitor traffic than friday end-of-day
1. The use of a monitor on table directly in front of visitor was better for legibility than on wall-mounted screen
1. Some young visitors were a bit _too_ aggressive with the controls
1. Asking what the visitors learned (and thus what they previously knew) was a useful question
