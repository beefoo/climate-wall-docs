## User research, feedback, and testing

The design and development of the Climate Wall will be iterative and driven by feedback from the public, staff, and team members.

### User research process

1. Development of prototypes will happen in about 2-week sprints of work
2. After each sprint, prototypes will be tested with a mix of public and staff unfamiliar with the project
    - Specific assumptions will be tested (e.g. user understands that track ball rotates globe)
    - Assumptions will be identified by the team during HoPE meetings
    - Assumptions will be validated/invalidated during the tests
3. The results will be shared and will inform the next sprint of work
4. Repeat

### Who will we test with?

In general, we want a **diverse set of testers** who represent communities with varied interests, needs, skills, and familiarity with climate change. This includes, but isn't limit to:

- Visitors (adult/child, new/frequent)
- Staff
- Educators
- Students (K-12, higher ed)
- People with disabilities (visual, hearing, motor, cognitive)
- Non-English speaking visitors
- Climate skeptics/deniers
- Varied familiarity with tech/science

### User research schedule and results

Coming soon. Will post schedule/results here when ready

### Conducting user studies

Coming soon. Will have a generic script and survey for conducting user studies for each prototype.

### Contributing feedback

While using the [online prototypes](https://beefoo.github.io/climate-lab/), there are a few ways to contribute feedback:

1. During HoPE meetings: feedback will be documented and added to a backlog
2. [Online form](https://goo.gl/forms/Qipw7xxgCSqpq9dp2): feedback will be collected, organized, and added to a backlog. [Responses will be added to this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NpO9iBn29Y2jsRMEhafRsJ_b_MPJ9j72z4deZo6XmtY/edit?usp=sharing).
3. [Github issues](https://github.com/beefoo/climate-lab/issues): this is how feedback will be tracked and organized (feedback from #1 and #2 will be translated here.) If you have a Github account, you can submit issues directly here and/or add comments to existing issues. This is also a good way to see what feedback has already be submitted.
